‚Ä¢	OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
‚Ä¢	Java Collections Framework (List, Map, Stream API)
‚Ä¢	Java Date/Time API (LocalDate, LocalDateTime)
‚Ä¢	File I/O using NIO.2 for importing/exporting CSV files
‚Ä¢	Menu-driven CLI with loops, switch statements, and labeled jumps
 Features
‚Ä¢	Student Management: Add, list, update, and deactivate students
‚Ä¢	Course Management: Add, list, update, deactivate, and search courses by instructor, department, or semester
‚Ä¢	Enrollment & Grading: Enroll/unenroll students, record marks, compute grades & GPA, print transcripts
‚Ä¢	File Operations: Import/export students and courses from CSV files, create backups, and recursively compute directory sizes

 Evolution of Java (Key Milestones)
‚Ä¢	1991 ‚Äì Project Green started by Sun Microsystems to create a portable, platform-independent language for consumer devices (originally called Oak).
‚Ä¢	1995 ‚Äì Official release of Java 1.0, introducing the ‚ÄúWrite Once, Run Anywhere‚Äù philosophy with the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
‚Ä¢	1998 ‚Äì Java 2 (J2SE 1.2) introduced Swing, Collections Framework, and a more robust API.
‚Ä¢	2004 ‚Äì Java 5 (J2SE 5.0) added Generics, Enums, Annotations, and the enhanced for-each loop.
‚Ä¢	2006 ‚Äì Sun open-sourced Java under the GPL and released the OpenJDK project.
‚Ä¢	2009‚Äì2010 ‚Äì Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and took over Java‚Äôs development.
‚Ä¢	2011 ‚Äì Java 7 introduced try-with-resources, NIO.2, and improved concurrency.
‚Ä¢	2014 ‚Äì Java 8 brought major functional programming features like Lambdas, Streams API, and a new Date/Time API.
‚Ä¢	2017 ‚Äì Oracle introduced a 6-month release cycle, starting with Java 9 (modules system).
‚Ä¢	2018‚Äì2021 ‚Äì Releases like Java 11, 14, and 17 added var keyword, switch expressions, records, and sealed classes.
‚Ä¢	Present (Java 21) ‚Äì Continues to evolve with pattern matching, virtual threads (Project Loom), and performance improvements while maintaining backward compatibility.

# Syllabus Topic ‚Üí Project Mapping
Syllabus Topic	Where It‚Äôs Demonstrated (File / Class / Method)	Explanation
OOP ‚Äì Classes & Objects	Student.java, Course.java, EnrollmentManager.java	Core entities are modeled as Java classes with fields, constructors, and methods.
Encapsulation (Getters/Setters)	Student.java (getId(), setEmail(), etc.)	Private fields with public getters/setters to protect data.
Inheritance & Polymorphism	Transcript printing via toString() in Student.java and Course.java	Overridden toString() methods provide polymorphic string output.
Abstraction (Interfaces/Enums)	Semester.java (enum), Grade.java (enum)	Enums abstract semester and grade logic.
Collections Framework	StudentManager.java (List<Student> students), CourseManager.java (List<Course> courses)	Uses ArrayList to store and manage data.
Stream API & Lambda	CourseManager.java ‚Üí searchByInstructor(), filterByDepartment(), filterBySemester()	Uses Streams and lambda expressions for filtering/searching.
Date/Time API	Student.java (LocalDate dob, enrollmentDate), FileOperations.java	Uses java.time.LocalDate for student DOB and timestamps.
Enums	Semester.java, Grade.java	Strongly typed constants for semesters and letter grades.
Exception Handling	FileOperations.java (try-catch in importStudents(), importCourses())	Handles IOException while reading CSV files.
File I/O (NIO.2)	FileOperations.java (Files.lines(), Path, Files.copy())	Demonstrates Files, Path, and Streams for import/export/backup.
CLI / Console I/O	MasterCLI.java (menu loop, switch)	Menu-driven console with Scanner, loops, and switch statements.
Decision Making	MasterCLI.java (switch cases), EnrollmentManager.java (if-else checks for max credits)	Conditional logic for user choices and enrollment rules.
Loops	MasterCLI.java (while loop for menu), StudentManager.java (enhanced-for loop to list students)	Demonstrates while, for, and enhanced-for loops.
Break / Continue / Labeled Jump	MasterCLI.java inside menu navigation	Shows break and continue in menu-driven logic.
Generics	List<Student>, List<Course> in all manager classes	Uses generic collections for type-safe data storage.
Static Members	GradeCalculator.java (static methods to compute GPA)	Provides utility methods without needing object creation.
Package Management	package java_project; in every class	Organizes code into a single logical package.
JDK/JRE/JVM	Project compilation & execution process	Demonstrated during project build (javac ‚Üí bytecode ‚Üí JVM execution).
JavaFX / GUI (Optional)	(Not applicable)	This project is console-based, but could be extended to GUI later.




 Assertions in Java
‚Ä¢	Assertions are used to test assumptions during runtime.
‚Ä¢	They help in debugging and catching programming errors early.
‚Ä¢	If the assertion condition is false, the JVM throws an AssertionError.
‚Ä¢	Assertions are disabled by default at runtime.
Example:
int age = -5;
assert age >= 0 : "Age cannot be negative!";
________________________________________
 Enabling Assertions
By default, running a Java program with:
java MyClass
will not evaluate assertions.
You must explicitly enable them using:
‚Ä¢	-ea ‚Üí enable assertions
‚Ä¢	-da ‚Üí disable assertions
‚Ä¢	-esa ‚Üí enable assertions in system classes (rarely needed)
________________________________________
 Sample Commands
1. Compile the Program
javac MyClass.java
This creates MyClass.class (bytecode).
2. Run With Assertions Enabled
java -ea MyClass
or, to enable assertions only in a specific package/class:
java -ea:java_project... MyClass
(Replace java_project with your package name)
3. Disable Assertions (Default)
java -da MyClass
4. Enable Assertions for System Classes
(Used if you want to check JDK internal classes too)
java -esa MyClass
________________________________________
 Project Example
If your main class is MasterCLI inside the java_project package:
javac java_project/MasterCLI.java
java -ea java_project.MasterCLI
________________________________________
 Tips
‚Ä¢	Use assert for development/testing, not for production validation (use exceptions instead).
‚Ä¢	Assertions can be selectively enabled per class or per package, which is useful for large projects.
‚Ä¢	You can combine options:
java -ea:java_project... -da:java_project.test... java_project.MasterCLI
This enables assertions for all classes in java_project but disables them in java_project.test.
